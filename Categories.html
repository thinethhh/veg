<!--Introduction text-->
    <p class="hometext">
        Out of the 250 turtle species, seven are sea turtles living in the ocean, while the rest are terrestrial turtles or live in freshwater. Sri Lankan shores are visited by five sea turtle species: Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead, and Leatherback. Sri Lanka also has three species of freshwater turtles and one terrestrial tortoise called the Star tortoise. Male sea turtles never return to land once they enter the sea as hatchlings, while females return to the same beach to nest and lay eggs after mating at sea. <br><br>The number of eggs laid varies among turtle species. After laying eggs and covering them with sand, the female returns to the sea. The trail left by her flippers helps predators and humans locate the nest. Only one or two hatchlings out of the numerous eggs survive to adulthood. Adult sea turtles are preyed upon by Great White Sharks, Tiger Sharks, and Orcas. According to the WWF, Olive Ridley is vulnerable, Loggerhead and Green are endangered, and Leatherback and Hawksbill are critically endangered among the sea turtle species nesting in Sri Lanka.</p>

        <h1>GREEN TURTLE</h1><br>
        <p>The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and the only herbivore among the different species. Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, not their shells. In the Eastern Pacific, a group of green turtles that have darker shells are called black turtles by the local community. Green turtles are found mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. Like other sea turtles, they migrate long distances between feeding grounds and the beaches from where they hatched. Classified as endangered, green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, being caught in fishing gear and loss of nesting beach sites.

         <h1>HAWKSBILL TURTLE</h1><br>
         <p>Hawksbill turtles are named for their pointed beak and distinctive shell pattern with serrated edges. Their shells are highly prized and sold as "tortoiseshell" due to their colorful appearance. These turtles primarily inhabit tropical oceans, particularly coral reefs. They feed on sponges, extracting them from reef crevices using their narrow beaks, but also consume sea anemones and jellyfish. Sea turtles have been present in Earth's seas for 100 million years, playing a vital role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the health of coral reefs and seagrass beds.

         <h1>OLIVE RIDLEY TURTLE</h1><br>
         <p>The Olive Ridley sea turtle derives its name from the olive green color of its shell. Despite being the most abundant among sea turtles, their vulnerable status arises from their nesting habits in a limited number of locations. Even a disturbance to a single nest beach can have significant repercussions on the entire population. This highlights the importance of protecting and preserving their nesting sites to ensure the long-term survival of Olive Ridley sea turtles and maintain their population stability.

         <p>Loggerhead turtles, named for their large heads and powerful jaws, can crush hard-shelled prey. They face less hunting pressure compared to other sea turtles but are significantly affected by bycatch. Loggerheads frequently encounter fisheries and are unintentionally captured in fishing gear. Sea turtles, existing for millions of years, play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by maintaining the health of coral reefs and seagrass beds. They are fundamental links in the marine ecosystem, ensuring its balance and vitality.

         <h1>LEATHERBACK TURTLE</h1><br>
         <p>Leatherback turtles, the largest sea turtle species, undertake remarkable migrations. Their wide distribution, although impacted by egg collection and fisheries bycatch, has seen a significant decline over the past century. Globally, leatherbacks are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, with specific subpopulations considered Critically Endangered. These turtles play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, and their conservation is vital for the preservation of their species and the overall health of our oceans.
