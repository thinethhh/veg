         <h1>01. FISHERIES BYCATCH</h1><br>
         <p>The fishing industry is responsible for the deaths of thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles each year. These magnificent creatures often get ensnared in longlines, gill nets, and trawls, being discarded as bycatch. Even those fortunate enough to escape fishing gear face adverse consequences. The disruption to their food supply and habitat leaves them vulnerable to further harm. It is a pressing concern that necessitates immediate attention and concerted efforts to mitigate these detrimental impacts on sea turtle populations.

         <h1>02. COASTAL DEVELOPMENT</h1><br>
         <p>Each year, the habitats of sea turtles suffer significant destruction due to the reduction of coastlines. The presence of boat vessel traffic, the construction of new hotels or high-rise buildings along the shore, and activities such as sea floor dredging and beach erosion greatly impact the availability of food supplies and nesting areas for sea turtles. Consequently, these factors contribute to the decline of sea turtle habitats and the challenges they face in finding suitable places to feed and reproduce.

         <h1>03. POLUTION AND PATHOGENS</h1><br>
         <p>Sea turtles are adversely affected by marine pollution in various ways. They encounter harm from plastic pollution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and debris as they ingest or become entangled in them. Additionally, ocean pollution has detrimental effects on the turtles' immune systems, disrupts their nesting behavior, and hampers the orientation of hatchlings. The presence of these pollutants and contaminants poses significant threats to the health, survival, and natural behaviors of sea turtles, highlighting the urgent need for measures to address and mitigate marine pollution to safeguard their well-being.

         <h1>04. DIRECT TAKE</h1><br>
         <p>Turtles worldwide face a grim fate as they are hunted and sold internationally for their shells, meat, oil, leather, and jewelry. The hawkbill turtle, in particular, has suffered immensely over the last century, with millions of them killed solely for the value of their shells. Despite conservation initiatives making progress in curbing the global trade of luxury and artisanal goods, turtles in Africa, Asia, and the Americas continue to face persistent threats from this industry.

         <h1>05. CLIMATE CHANGE</h1><br>
         <p>Our understanding of the impact of climate change on sea turtles is growing. Climate change has the potential to disrupt the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the vulnerability to disease outbreaks, and intensify the occurrence of extreme weather events. These events, including storms and rising sea levels, pose a significant threat as they destroy vital nesting beaches and fragile coral reefs. Recognizing the intricate relationship between climate change and sea turtles is crucial for implementing effective conservation strategies and mitigating the adverse effects on their populations and habitats.
