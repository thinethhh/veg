<!--Introduction text-->
    <p class="hometext">Unfortunately, sea turtle populations around the world are on a sharp decline due to natural predators and severe human interference. One of the biggest problems in Sri Lanka are human poachers, who mishandle the eggs to sell to turtle sanctuaries or to locals as a source of food or medicine. Another major problem is actually the 40 so called sanctuaries that line the west coast of Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, these projects are set up purely to make money from tourists, with many cruel practices happening day in day out.<br><br>

    We regularly visit many of the sanctuaries nearby, where many hundreds of volunteers from around the world go every year to supposedly help. There is absolutely no conservation happening and nine times out of ten they are actually making the situation worse. Some of the bigger problems include; many healthy sea turtles being confined to very small tanks without being able to swim or dive, thousands of tourists holding turtles (often dropping them), baby sea turtles being kept in tanks for many weeks before being released (therefore using up all of their energy and any hope of survival) and most sanctuaries from what we can tell have a very low hatching success rate and are mainly producing males. <br><br>
        
    Our aim of the programme is simple; to conserve the critically endangered sea turtles that nest upon the shores of Sri Lanka.</p>

    <strong>NIGHT BEACH PATROLS</strong><br><br>
    <p>
        Your main task is to patrol nearby beaches, searching for nesting sea turtles. Walking along pristine sandy shores, listening to crashing waves, you'll have the opportunity to witness the sight of turtles coming to nest. Your responsibility includes transporting discovered eggs to our hatchery for their safety. Shifts generally last 1 to 2 hours, covering 1 to 4km.

    <strong>HATCHERY GUARDING</strong><br><br>
    <p>
       You will have the important task of caring for the hatchery, ensuring the safety of all the nests from potential predators. During this period, you will be entrusted with weighing, measuring, and ultimately releasing all newly hatched turtles into the vast ocean. It's a significant role where you play a key role in safeguarding the hatchlings' journey and facilitating their transition into their natural habitat.

    <strong>RELEASING BABY TURTLES</strong><br><br>
    <p>
        By far the most popular and best activity, you will get the chance to release newly hatched babies into the sea. This rewarding activity is of course why we are all here and there is no better experience than knowing you have contributed to the wild sea turtle populations. For the best chance of survival, the babies are released as soon as they hatch at differing locations.

      <strong>SEA TURTLE RESCUE</strong><br><br>
      <p>
        Our local team and volunteers are always ready to rescue sea turtles in need. They respond to calls from fishermen who accidentally catch turtles in their nets and from locals who come across distressed or trapped turtles. Volunteers play a vital role in rehabilitating and releasing these turtles back into the sea once they are healthy.

      <strong>TANK CLEANING AND REFILLING</strong><br><br>
    <p>
        Maintaining cleanliness in our two tanks is crucial for the well-being of sea turtles under our care. Even during periods without turtles, we must remain prepared and attentive. While it may seem like a straightforward task, it can be physically demanding without pumping equipment, especially in the heat.

      <p>
        While it may not be the most thrilling task, the significance of ensuring a clean and tidy coastline along the project site cannot be overstated. This directly contributes to the conservation by creating an inviting environment for more females to come lay their eggs. By securing their nesting grounds, we play a pivotal role in safeguarding their future generations.
